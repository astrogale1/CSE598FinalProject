# CSE598FinalProject

This is Gale Moore's final project for CSE 598.

Unfortunately, the models themselves were too large to be uploaded through GitHub, so you may need to run main.py to generate them (as it makes 24, put aside a couple hours for this).

evaluators.py is used to generate an output .txt that lists all results, while toCSV.py converts that output into a .csv file which is easier to analyze.
